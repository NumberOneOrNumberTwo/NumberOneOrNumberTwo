# Inspiration

One day, on my way home, getting of the train I was surprised by this instense need to pee. I wanted to pee so bad and I knew the train station didn't have a restroom. It was such an adventure until I found a bathroom almost 15 minutes later that I promissed myself I would build an interactive database for people to find, insert and give ratings to restrooms.
